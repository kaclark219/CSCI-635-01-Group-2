# Project To-Do

## Completed
- [x] Imported data, split into training/validation/testing sets, & resized images
- [x] Created balanced training data by transforming processed images
- [x] Implemented three baseline models (K-NN, SVM, & DT Forest)
- [x] Logged training statistics, hyperparameter rankings, and results for baselines
- [x] Started CNN architecture

## Next Steps (High Priority, Current Roadblock)
- [ ] Finish CNN
- [ ] Log CNN results

## Future Plans
- [ ] Compare strengths/weaknesses of models using confusion matrices
- [ ] Create figures to describe training vs. testing accuracy of all models (determine overfitting/underfitting)
- [ ] Provide a critical analysis of the approaches used & justify which method performed best
- [ ] Discuss the limitations of your work as well as potential avenues for improvement
- [ ] Write abstract in README
- [ ] Create presentation slides
